# Bootstraps a VM for configuration by Ansible - this only needs to be run once per host.
# This playbook is kept provider specific so it can be called safely by Vagrant using the 'all' hosts option.

# This play is needed to discover information about the control computer so Ansible can access your local username.
# This is needed where the BARC.prelude role is used as the public key will be named after your local username.

- name: gather facts from control machine to get local username
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local

# Do not change the hosts value for this play - Vagrant will pass a special inventory file with suitable connection
# details automatically. Changing this value will prevent this dynamic inventory being used and cause a fatal error.
